<p class=misctitle><a href="http://donationethics.com">Donation Ethics</a></p>
<p class=mgap>The Department of Health and Human Services is <a target='_blank' href="http://www.regulations.gov/document?D=HRSA_FRDOC_0001-0115">considering an amendment</a> to the National Organ Transplant Act that would effectively make it illegal to compensate donors of bone marrow stem cells collected through a process similar to blood donation, just as it is illegal to compensate for such cells collected directly from the bone marrow (through a much more invasive and painful procedure). My friend and colleague, <a href="http://explore.georgetown.edu/people/pj87/">Peter Jaworski</a> put together an open letter to the HHS arguing against this amendment, which I and several other ethicists signed. I also helped edit the letter and put together the website.</p>

<p class=indentend>An audio recording (MP3) of a tribute I offered at R. G. Frey's memorial service in April 2013. Ray was a philosopher at BGSU for 26 years; he passed away in 2012.</p>
